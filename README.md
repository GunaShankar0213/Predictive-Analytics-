## 1. EHR Data Analysis  
This project explores **Electronic Health Records (EHR)** to analyze patient heart data.  
### Key Objectives:  
- Study and preprocess large-scale EHR datasets.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in patient heart conditions.  
- Visualize critical metrics such as heart rate, cholesterol levels, and diagnosis trends.  
- Apply predictive models to assess the risk of heart disease based on clinical data.  

**Tools & Techniques:**  
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation.  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization.  
- Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees).

## 2. Sentiment Analysis on Tweets  
This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze tweet sentiments.  

### Key Features:  
- Preprocessing tweet data to clean and standardize text.  
- Implementing **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for feature extraction.  
- Using **XGBoost** for classification to achieve high accuracy in sentiment detection.  
- Enhancing text mining skills by analyzing patterns in public opinion.  

**Applications:**  
- Detecting positive, negative, or neutral sentiments in social media data.  
- Understanding customer feedback for businesses.

## 3. Customer Churn Prediction  
Predicting customer churn is crucial for business retention strategies. This project focuses on:  
### Highlights:  
- Analyzing customer behavior to identify churn indicators.  
- Extracting and processing features such as usage patterns, complaints, and payment history.  
- Training predictive models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to classify customers into churn and non-churn categories.  
- Providing actionable insights to minimize churn rates and improve customer satisfaction.  

**Technologies Used:**  
- Pandas, Scikit-learn for feature engineering and modeling.  
- XGBoost for boosting performance on imbalanced datasets.  
- Power BI/Tableau for dashboard visualization of churn trends.
