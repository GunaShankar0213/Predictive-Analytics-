# Fine-Tuning for Sentiment Classification

Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task, such as sentiment classification. It allows leveraging the pre-trained knowledge of large models while tailoring them to domain-specific datasets for improved performance.

## Steps for Fine-Tuning in Sentiment Classification  

1. **Choose a Pre-trained Model**:  
   Select a model like **BERT**, **RoBERTa**, or **DistilBERT**, which are widely used for NLP tasks.  

2. **Prepare the Dataset**:  
   - Collect and preprocess the dataset (e.g., clean text, remove noise, tokenize).  
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.  

3. **Set Up the Environment**:  
   - Install libraries like `Transformers` and `PyTorch` or `TensorFlow`.  
   - Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer.  

   Example in Python:  
   ```python
   from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification

   tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
   model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=3)
   inputs = tokenizer(texts, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")
   ```
Tokenize and Encode:
Tokenize the text and convert it into input tensors for the model.
##Train the Model:
- Define the loss function (e.g., CrossEntropy).
- Use an optimizer like AdamW and a learning rate scheduler.
- Train the model using the training set and validate on the validation set.

##Evaluate:
Test the model on unseen data to measure its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

##Deploy:
Use the fine-tuned model to classify new text inputs into sentiment categories.
